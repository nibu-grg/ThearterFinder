-**HTML:** This is the main part of the web application, utilized the development of the web page's content and structure.

-**CSS:** It is used to improve the application's visual attractiveness through layout, font, and color styling.

-**JavaScript:** Purpose of this is to make the interface more dynamic and interactive. 

### Back End ###
-**Node.js:** Node.js is a event-driven runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used on the server side. It is mainly used to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently.

### Database ###
-**MySQL:** It is an open source relational database management system(RDBMS) that's used to store and manage data. 

## Conclusion ##

The Theater Management System makes data handling easier and quicker. The system simplifies data management procedures for the administrator by embedding all the major administrative features: create, read, update, and remove theatrical metadata. With an outstanding tech stack-HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Node.js, this application assures scalability, reliability, and ease for end-users.

This project, emphasizing real-life needs for data organization, user interaction, and maintenance of the system, shows the practical application of concepts from web development and database administration.

The conclusion is that the Theater Management System is a good starting point for new improvements, such as adding some user-oriented functionality like theatre search and advanced filtering. It is a helpful tool within the context of theater management because it illustrates the prospect of continued evolution toward meeting the growing demands of consumers.
